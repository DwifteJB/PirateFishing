# an extremely simple fishing game

you can play this at [my website!](https://rmfosho.me/fish)

this is my **SECOND** threejs project, so it was an attempt to make something 3d and "playable"

## what is it run on?

basic vite, react, some tailwind for ui, threejs and thats pratically it.

it uses terrain generation, which can be seen in [src/components/Terrain.tsx](https://github.com/DwifteJB/PirateFishing/blob/main/src/components/Terrain.tsx).
the fishing minigame can be found in [src/components/FishingUI.tsx](https://github.com/DwifteJB/PirateFishing/blob/main/src/components/FishingUI.tsx)
